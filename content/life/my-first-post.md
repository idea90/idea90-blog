Welcome! This is my very first blog post on **idea90 blog**.

Hello, my name is Idea. I’m the tech guy.

I created this blog for all the tech-savvy people out there who like to break things and fix things.

I’m from Laos, and my grammar isn’t perfect, but at least I can type in English. Sometimes I use ChatGPT to help fix my spelling and writing because if I write raw straight from my keyboard, it can be really hard to read. So ChatGPT helps me make it clearer.

Yes, AI is gonna take over the world—blah blah—but I need to use it if you want to read my blog.

Here, I write about everything — things that happen in my life or big global events. If you ask me political or controversial questions, I stand with Palestine and Ukraine.

That’s it! If I’m not lazy, I’ll keep posting.
